However, the Market Street corridor is known for heavy pedestrian and bicycle traffic, as well as public transit (buses and streetcars).  The area also experiences frequent double-parking and delivery vehicles, increasing the risk for incidents even with lighter traffic flow. The relatively high risk score of 75.06 may reflect these inherent area hazards."

The risk score of 5.38 is already elevated, likely due to the inherent complexity of navigating this area with its mix of vehicle types, pedestrians, and public transportation.  The additional risk accounts for the presence of Market Street's many transit lines, including buses and streetcars, which can create unpredictable traffic flow.  Bicyclists and scooter riders are also common, increasing the need for heightened awareness."
